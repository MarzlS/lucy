# Lucy Conversation
> Chat with Lucy!

This recipe is based on [IBM TJBot](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot) and uses the [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/) and other Watson services to turn Lucy into a chatting robot.

Some possible things to tell her:

* "Lucy how are you?" - To get to know about her feelings.
* "Hello Lucy" - Lucy will say hello and waves her arm.
* "Lucy turn the light to red" - Switch the LED to the given color.
* "Lucy start disco party" - Rotate through all LED colors.
* "What time is it, Lucy?" - Lucy tells you the time.
* "Lucy what is this?" - Lucy takes a photo and tries to guess what she sees.
* "Lucy go to bed" - Ends the conversation


## Hardware
This recipe requires a TJBot with a microphone, a speaker, a LED, a servo arm and a camera.


## Build and Run

### Bootstrap
First, make sure you have configured your Raspberry Pi for TJBot by following the [bootstrap instructions](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/tree/master/bootstrap).

### Using Audio and the LED together
To use the LED and Audio in paralled I use an external USB sound card.

To get this up and running Audio must be blacklisted, but not all modules!

After bootstrap script has been run enter

    $ sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/tjbot-blacklist-snd.conf

and delete the last line:

    $ blacklist snd

Save the changes and restart the system.

### Dependencies and configuration

Next, go to the `lucy` folder and install the dependencies.

    $ cd lucy
    $ npm install

Import the `workspace-lucy.json` file into the Watson Assistant service and note the workspace ID.

Create instances of all the required Watson services and note the authentication credentials.

Make a copy the default configuration file and update it with the Watson service credentials and the conversation workspace ID.

    $ cp config.default.js config.js
    $ nano config.js
    <enter your service credentials and the conversation workspace ID in the specified places>

### Run!

    sudo node lucy.js

> Note the `sudo` command. Root user access is required to run TJBot recipes.
